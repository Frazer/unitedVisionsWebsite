    <p>As a young man, I had a vision that changed my life forever. After a tragic incident in my family, it hit me that the world does not have to be the way it is right now, that we can help each other be happier, wiser, and more caring.</p>

    <p> I dedicated myself to making the world the way it could be, or as I phrased it at the time, the way it is meant to be. A world where every single person has access to the best training to be happy, to be positive, and to have peace. But more importantly than that, I want to train people with the skills to be the designers of themselves and our communities.</p>
